01. Remove older docker version if installed
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io

02. Make sure you have the necessary packages to allow the use of Docker’s repository:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

03. Add Docker’s GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

04. Add the stable Docker repository:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Note
For Ubuntu 19.04 if you get an E: Package 'docker-ce' has no installation candidate error this is because the stable version of docker 
for is not yet available. Therefore, you will need to use the edge / test repository.

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable edge test"

05. Update your package index and install Docker CE:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce

06. Add your limited Linux user account to the docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Note
After entering the usermod command, you will need to close your SSH session and open a new one for this change to take effect.

07. Check that the installation was successful by running the built-in “Hello World” program:
docker run hello-world
